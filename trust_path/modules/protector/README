= SUMMARY =

Xoops Protector is a module to defend XOOPS2 from various and malicious attacks.

This module can protect a various kind of attacks like:

- DoS
- Bad Crawlers (like bots collecting e-mails...)
- SQL Injection
- XSS (not all though)
- System globals pollution
- Session hi-jacking
- Null-bytes
- Directory Traversal
- Some kind of CSRF (fatal in XOOPS <= 2.0.9.2)
- Brute Force
- Camouflaged Image File Uploading (== IE Content-Type XSS)
- Executable File Uploading Attack
- XMLRPC's eval() and SQL Injection Attacks
- SPAMs for comment, trackback etc.

Xoops Protector defends you XOOPS from these attacks, and it records into its log. 

Of course, all vulnerablities can't be prevented.
Be not overconfident, please.

However, I [color=ff0000][b]strongly[/b][/color] recommend installing this module to all XOOPS sites with any versions.



= INSTALL =

First, define XOOPS_TRUST_PATH into mainfile.php if you've never done it yet.

Copy html/modules/protector in the archive into your XOOPS_ROOT_PATH/modules/
Copy xoops_trust_path/modules/protector in the archive into your XOOPS_TRUST_PATH/modules/

Turn permission of XOOPS_TRUST_PATH/modules/protector/configs writable

After Xoops Protector is installed, edit your mainfile.php like this:
[code]
	[color=ff0000]include XOOPS_TRUST_PATH.'/modules/protector/include/precheck.inc.php' ;[/color]
	if (!isset($xoopsOption['nocommon']) [color=0000ff]&& XOOPS_ROOT_PATH != ''[/color] ) {
		include XOOPS_ROOT_PATH."/include/common.php";
	}
	[color=ff0000]include XOOPS_TRUST_PATH.'/modules/protector/include/postcheck.inc.php' ;[/color]
[/code]
Just add two red-colored lines.
If the blue-colored part is different from your mainfile.php, don't mind it.

Both pre-check and post-check are needed.

An option "DENY by .htaccess" is added on version 2.34.
If you try this option, set writable XOOPS_ROOT_PATH/.htaccess
Before installing this, you should compare it to the security risks which .htaccess is writable.


= How to rescue =

If you've been banned from Protector, just delete files under XOOPS_TRUST_PATH/modules/protector/configs/

The setting and controller of "rescue password" has been eliminated.


= How to install it into XOOPS Cube Legacy 2.1 =

Almost the same as installing into XOOPS 2.0.x.
There is just a different with the patching point in mainfile.php.
Refer this.
[code]
    if (!defined('_LEGACY_PREVENT_LOAD_CORE_') && XOOPS_ROOT_PATH != '') {
        include XOOPS_TRUST_PATH.'/modules/protector/include/precheck.inc.php' ;
        @include_once XOOPS_ROOT_PATH.'/include/cubecore_init.php';
        if (!isset($xoopsOption['nocommon']) && !defined('_LEGACY_PREVENT_EXEC_COMMON_')) {
            include XOOPS_ROOT_PATH.'/include/common.php';
        }
        include XOOPS_TRUST_PATH.'/modules/protector/include/postcheck.inc.php' ;
    }
[/code]

= How to install it into ImpressCMS 1.1 =

Almost the same as installing into XOOPS 2.0.x.
There is no need to patch mainfile.php or create a Trust Path with ImpressCMS 1.1 or later.

After you have uploaded all the files to the server in the correct location,
you need to copy the contents of the 'ImpressCMS_Extras' folder to the root of your ImpressCMS installation.
Once completed, you may install Protector from the modules admin as normal.

= UPGRADE from Protector 2.x =

- remove two lines for Protector from your mainfile.php
- remove all files under XOOPS_ROOT_PATH/modules/protector/ via FTP etc.
- upload files in the archive (refer INSTALL)
- do "upgrade" Protector in modulesadmin
- add two lines for Protector into your mainfile.php

Note: "XOOPS_TRUST_PATH" for 3.0 instead of "XOOPS_ROOT_PATH" for 2.x


= Using filter-plugin =

You can put a filter-plugin in XOOPS_TRUST_PATH/modules/protector/filters_enabled/

There are two plugins in this archive.

- postcommon_post_deny_by_rbl.php
an anti-SPAM plugin.
All of Post from IP registered in RBL will be rejected.
This plugin can slow the performance of Post, especially chat modules.

- postcommon_post_need_multibyte.php
an anti-SPAM plugin.
Post without multi-byte characters will be rejected.
This plugin is only for sites of japanese, tchinese, schinese, and korean.

If you want to turn the plugin on, copy the file in filters_disabled into filters_enabled.
